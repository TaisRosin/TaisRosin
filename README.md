### 💜 About Me

Hi! My name is Taís, I’m an **Information Systems** student and I work with **Data Migration**.

My current work involves organizing and executing data migration projects from one ERP system to another, with the main goal of minimizing the impacts that data migration usually brings to a company.

I’m driven by the daily chaos, problems that seem unsolvable, and well-organized, structured projects.
